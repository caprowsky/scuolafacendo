RDF is a W3C standard for modeling and sharing distributed knowledge based on a
decentralized open-world assumption. This RDF package for Drupal 7 includes
several modules to enhance the RDF and RDFa functionnalities which are part of
Drupal 7 core.

- RDFx provides APIs for developers to manipulate RDF data, as well as output
  Drupal's data as RDF/XML, nTriples or Turtle.
- RDF UI allows site administrators to manage the RDF mappings of their site:
  alter default core mappings or specify mappings for the new content types and
  fields they create.
- Evoc enables the import of RDF vocabularies (such as FOAF, SIOC, etc.) which
  the site administrator can use to map Drupal data to RDF.


== Install the RDF module ==

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/rdf/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Modules and enable the RDFx module and
     any other module you like. You will find them in the "RDF" section.

  3. Install the ARC2 library following one of these 2 options:
       - run "drush rdf-download" (recommended, it will download the right
         package and extract it at the right place for you.)
       - manual install: download the library from
       http://github.com/semsol/arc2/tarball/master and extract it in the rdf
       module directory such that you end up with the following file structure:
       sites/all/modules/rdf/vendor/arc/ARC2.php

== Credits ==
The original RDF module was written for Drupal 6 by Arto Bendiken. It has been
refactored for Drupal 7 by Stéphane Corlosquet, Lin Clark and Richard Cyganiak,
based on the RDF CCK and Evoc modules, which are now part of the main RDF
package for Drupal 7.
